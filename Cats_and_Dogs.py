This Streamlit app demonstrates a binary image classifier for cats and dogs 
using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The CNN is trained on a balanced 
dataset of 4,000 images, containing 2,000 cat and 2,000 dog images. The app leverages 
Streamlit's capabilities to create a user-friendly interface for image 
uploading and classification. Upon uploading an image, the app pre-processes it 
(resizing, normalization) and feeds it through the trained CNN model. 
The model's output is then interpreted to predict whether the image contains 
a cat or a dog.
